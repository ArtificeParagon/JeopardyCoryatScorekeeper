# JeopardyCoryatScorekeeper

Keep track of your Jeopardy scores while watching episodes!

TODO
====

-Add six extra tiles at the top where users can type in the categories in each round (sometimes it's hard to keep track if the game is moving fast)
-Process stats and output reports in some meaningful way (avg score all-time, in a range, etc)
